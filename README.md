# Image_Classification_KNN_CNN_SVM

=> Used Caltech 101 Dataset and compare the following ML algorithms.
a) K-Nearest Neighbour
b) Non-linear SVM
c) Deep Convolutional Neural Network (VGGNet or GoogLeNet or ResNet )

=> Use train-validation-test split as 80% train, 10% validation and 10% test.

 => Printed the train, validation and test error for your model.

=> Gained an understanding of how your models are performing, please score each
model against three metrics: Precision, Recall and Accuracy.

=> Plotted ROC curve for each model for the comparison of results.
 
=> Stated which ML model is best among the given models based on ROC curve analysis.
